<h2>About Us</h2>

<p> A contract manufacturing (CM) company that manufactures electronic circuit boards for
large OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers). The OEMs design the hardware and circuits,
and the CMs build the boards using the designs provided. The CMs use start-of-the-art 
manufacturing assembly techniques which include automated assembly lines where machines
place the parts on pre-painted circuit boards, send them through ovens where the parts are
soldered to the boards, and wash the boards after they are soldered. THe process involves
set ups of the placement machines for each board; programming the profiles of the "ovens"
so the temperatures are appropriate for the boards. After the boards come off the lines,
they are tested using Automated Test equipment. Failures are tracked and brought to an
in-house Failure Analysis lab to determine whi the parts are failing and to determine
where in the process problems might be occurring.
